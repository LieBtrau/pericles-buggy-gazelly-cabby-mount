# pericles-buggy-gazelly-cabby-mount

The Gazelle Cabby is a practical bike to move your children around, although it has its limitations.  Babies can be carried in a MaxiCosi-seat, mounted onto the bike.  Preschoolers can be transported on the bench mounted into the bike.  For toddlers, there's no solution.  

So I decided to make my own.  I have a [baby trolley](http://www.pericles.be/nl/producten/4124166510793/ik-wandel/wandelwagens-urban/ww-urban-forest-steel) with removable chair.  That chair wil be mounted onto a piece of woodboard, mounted into the [Gazelle Cabby](https://www.gazellebikes.com/usa/bikes/cabby-c7).   

You'll need a piece of woodboard, sawn to fit.  I used some leftover piece from the cupboard in my kitchen.  Details of cutting the woodboard are not given here.  
The raw material for milling is a 10mm thick Delrin board.  Five different pieces will have to be milled, two each.
The g-code in this project describes only the milling actions.  Some of the pieces require extra work on other surfaces.  This couldn't be done on the milling machine I had, so I did that by hand.
